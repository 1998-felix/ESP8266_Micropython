# ESP8266_Micropython
This reporsitory details my efforts to install, program and deploy scripts on the esp8266 wifi module with 1 MB of flash Memory using Micropython
it is not that i do not believe in arduino or AT commands or acknowledge their relative speed.
The main aim is to learn and push forth the gospel of abstraction through micropython. 
I love Python, I hate JavaScript(though it seems I will never be able to escape it) and I hope i will love Micropython.
